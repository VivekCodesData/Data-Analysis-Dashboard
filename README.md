# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
Need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to improve efficiency and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help stakeholders monitor, analyze, and make better decisions for managing patients and improving services.

# Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/VivekCodesData/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Hospital%20Emergency%20Room%20Data.csv">Dataset</a>

#Questions & KPI'S
- Number of Patients:
- Average Wait Time:
- Patient Satisfaction Score:
- Patient Admission Status: Show how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted.
- Patient Age Distribution: Group patients by age.
- Timeliness: Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
- Gender Analysis: Display the number of patients by gender. 
- Department Referrals: Check which departments patients are referred to the most.

  #Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same. (Using Power Query)
- Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Add Some Dax Formulas For Creating Age Groups
- And Create Cleander Table in Power Query. 
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.
- And Create Some Pivot Charts

#üîç Key Insights to Include in a Patient Dashboard:

1. Age Group Distribution:
* Create a chart (e.g., bar or pie chart) showing how many patients fall into different age groups (e.g., 0‚Äì18, 19‚Äì35, 36‚Äì60, 60+).
* This helps in understanding which age group requires more services.
2. Gender Breakdown:
* Show the percentage of male vs. female patients (or other genders) using a donut chart or stacked bar chart.
3. Visit Trends Over Time:
* Line chart showing the number of patient visits per month or week.
* Helps identify seasonal or time-based patterns in patient flow.
4. Common Diagnoses or Health Conditions:
* Use a horizontal bar chart to display the top 5 or 10 health issues patients come in with.
5. Appointment Status Summary:
* Track how many appointments are scheduled, completed, missed, or canceled.
* Can be displayed using KPI cards or colored tiles.
6. Department or Doctor-Wise Patient Count:
* Show which departments (e.g., cardiology, pediatrics) are handling more patients.
* You can use a table or stacked column chart.
7. Location/Area-Wise Patient Data (if available):
* If you have patient address or region, visualize where most patients come from using a map chart or area-wise filter.
8. Insurance Status or Payment Method:
* Show how many patients are insured vs. self-pay or government coverage.
